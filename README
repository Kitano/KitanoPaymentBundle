KitanoPaymentSipsBundle
=======================

This bundle symfony2 is used to manage payments. You have to use another payment bundle for each payment system.
Kitano is just a namespace for bundles created by Kitpages (http://www.kitpages.fr) and Anonymation (www.anonymation.com).

This bundle is still in alpha state and this documentation is only used by developpeurs to follow the evolution.
