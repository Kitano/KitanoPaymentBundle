KitanoPaymentBundle
===================

This bundle symfony2 is used to manage payments. You have to use another payment bundle for each payment system.
Kitano is just a namespace for bundles created by Kitpages (http://www.kitpages.fr) and Anonymation (http://www.anonymation.com).

This bundle is in a stable state for a simple payment processing.

The following payments systems are supported :

* SIPS (mercanet, elysnet, citelys,...)

You can see a (very) small documentation in french on this page :
